# theme-iheritance
Nodejs code that traverses through the files of a parent theme, check its files against other themes, and try to keep them up-to date with the parent one.

This is a specific-use file that cannot be used in other places. In case you want to use it in your project, make sure to change the pathes for imported components and widgets.
